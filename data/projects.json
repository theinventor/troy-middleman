    "description":"My brother Blair and I put this app together at a hackathon.  We decided to follow through for fun and turn it into a live app on the marketplace.  You can go download it from apple here:<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/qr-sync/id469820330?ls=1&mt=8\">http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/qr-sync/id469820330?ls=1&mt=8</a><br><br>\r\nIt's a barcode scanner that will give you the ability to instantly share scan results to facebook and twitter, or create a google task with the scan result.  The scan results will be placed on a map so you can see where you were when you scanned something, and if it's a product we can find at amazon we'll give you a buy link.<br>\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ExInan9io_I?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

It scratched an itch of mine.  I wanted to know who was calling me if they weren't in my address book.  What we learned in doing this is that MOST cell phone providers actually put your name in the database so we can get names for most cell phone callers that aren't in your address book!  Pretty cool.  We offer a free trial to get 5 incoming calls and see it work.  It won't get names for Verizon callers, and Verizon users have to be on Wi-Fi due to the network limitations.  Go download it for android.","id":7,"image":"https://ssl.gstatic.com/android/market/com.realcallerid.callerid/ss-0-320-480-160-1-ac6b6a08eeff7e139865f86af3040efb8b3d703c","link":"http://www.realcallerid.com","name":"Real Caller ID","solo":false,"status":"Live","updated_at":"2012-02-27T00:42:25Z"},
